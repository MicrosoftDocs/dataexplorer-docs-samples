Although the flooding was moderately severe, this crest was over two and a half feet lower than the major flood in January, 2005. Extensive bottomland flooding affected agricultural and rural residential areas. Several rural county roads flooded. A few residents moved out of an area locally known as Dodge City. Several small oil fields were inaccessible. Since this occurred outside of agricultural season, little or no crop damage occurred. High water isolated some river cabin residents.

Just south of the building, metal roofs had been torn off a structure and tossed toward the north.  In the south parking lot adjacent to the building, three telephone poles were blown down...one toward the west???one toward the north???and one toward the south.  An officer was in his vehicle at 7:08 am CST as the storm struck???parked next to a large metal building which partly protected it.  The officer reported that very high winds and heavy rain began blowing from north to south???then abruptly changed direction and began blowing from south to north???accompanied by penny-sized hail.  His car???in spite of being somewhat sheltered???was badly damaged by the blowing debris.  In all???thirty-five vehicles at the Police Building sustained damage???with numerous dents and large gashes in car bodies???as well as windows and windshields fractured.  A large area of brick was ejected from an upper portion of the Building???s north wall.  The conclusion of the survey team was that this damage at the Police Headquarters was due to a small and short-lived tornado that occurred just behind the 70 to 80 mph thunderstorm winds. Damage was also found about 200 yards north of the Police Building at a business that manufactures lighting fixtures.  This was thought to be a second touchdown of the small tornado.  Here a large dumpster was spun almost 360 degrees and several trailers were slammed into each other. A single-wide trailer was tipped over on its side.  Windows and doors at the building were broken, with some blown inward and some blown outward.  Based on the type and level of damage, the tornado was rated an F1 on the Fujita Scale, and an EF1 on the new Enhanced Fujita Scale.  The tornado path was estimated to be 100 yards wide and a three-tenths of a mile long."",
